<p>Hello, and welcome to this short article on the &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E; declaration in HTML5. </p>
<p>The &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E; declaration is an important part of your HTML document that tells a web browser which version of HTML you are using. It is the first line of code and should be one of the very first things written into your HTML document. </p>
<p>If you are writing in HTML5, the &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E; declaration should look like this: </p>
<pre><code>&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note that the &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E; declaration is not case sensitive; so `&#x3C;!doctype html&#x3E;`, `&#x3C;!Doctype html&#x3E;`, and `&#x3C;!DOCTYPE HTML&#x3E;` are all valid. </p>
<p>However, if you do not use the correct &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E; declaration then your web browser may interpret the HTML page incorrectly, leading to unexpected results. </p>
<p>Now let's take a look at an example of how the `&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;` declaration is used in a simple HTML5 document:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;
        &#x3C;html&#x3E;
        &#x3C;head&#x3E;
            &#x3C;title&#x3E;My Document&#x3C;/title&#x3E;
        &#x3C;/head&#x3E;
        &#x3C;body&#x3E;
            &#x3C;h1&#x3E;Welcome to My Website!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;
            &#x3C;p&#x3E;This is a sample HTML document.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
        &#x3C;/body&#x3E;
        &#x3C;/html&#x3E;
    </code>
</pre>
    <p>As you can see, the `&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;` declaration is at the very top of the document, before the `<html>` tag. This tells the web browser that the document is written in HTML5, ensuring correct interpretation and rendering of the page.</p>
