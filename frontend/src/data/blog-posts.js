I like to use Namecheap for buying domains and hosting since they have excellent customer service, among other great benefits. Another essential thing to note before installing WordPress is checking that your web hosting provider fulfills the necessary software and conditions. Also, you must have access to the server and some tools. So the requirements on the server side are PHP 7.4 or greater and having MySQL 5.6 or MariaDB 10.1 or greater. I&apos;m going to leave a link to a detailed list of requirements in the description of this video (1)&nbsp;",

    content: "The HTML `&#x3C;head&#x3E;` tag is a crucial element of a website and can be found at the top of each page, right inside the opening `&#x3C;html&#x3E;` tag. The HTML `&#x3C;head&#x3E;` tag's purpose is to provide additional information about the web page. Inside the `&#x3C;head&#x3E;` tag, there are several other HTML tags you can use, each serving a unique purpose. Tags like `&#x3C;title&#x3E;`, which defines the title shown in the browser's title bar or tabs; `&#x3C;style&#x3E;` for embedding CSS styles; and `&#x3C;meta&#x3E;` tags for providing metadata about the HTML document. You can also use `&#x3C;link&#x3E;` to link external resources like CSS files, and `&#x3C;script&#x3E;` to link JavaScript files or write inline JavaScript. It's important to note that the contents of the `&#x3C;head&#x3E;` tag are not rendered on the web page, instead, they provide information to the browser and the search engines.",
